I needed to simply archive my slack history.  After looking at the available
projects to do this, I was unable to find one that had no requirements on
installing a bunch of other libraries.  Checking the Slack API specs, it
seemed simple enough, so I reluctantly re-invented the wheel.

Firstly, use the slack user interface to get an API token.

All commands will show a summary output as well as creating a file with
the raw json data in the current directory.

Usage:

    slack-export $TOKEN channels.list
    slack-export $TOKEN channels.history [id..]
    slack-export $TOKEN groups.list
    slack-export $TOKEN users.list
    slack-export $TOKEN im.list
    slack-export $TOKEN im.history [id..]

    slack-export $TOKEN
        running the exporter without any command will run all the other
        commands in sequence - essentially performing a full export.

TODO

Some features were not implemented:
* groups.history
* "mpim"
